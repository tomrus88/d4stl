Hash: 5DD709D0, Key: XboxBootModalBody, Value: This game is a community driven experience, and to participate in multiplayer activities such as chatting with friends, trading items, engaging in PvP, and joining a Clan, you must be connected online and have an active Xbox Game Pass Core subscription. We highly recommend this as it's the way Diablo was intended to be played. Welcome to Sanctuary adventurer, and good luck.
