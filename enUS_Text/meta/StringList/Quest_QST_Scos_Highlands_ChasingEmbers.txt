Torben wants to speak with me at Under the Fat Goose Inn. I should speak with him to find how we can put a stop to Blackweald Company.

He says the cursed place is sure to be a welcome home to Blackweald Company and their obsession with the Days of Ash.

Torben will join me at the Scar to hunt for clues to their location.
