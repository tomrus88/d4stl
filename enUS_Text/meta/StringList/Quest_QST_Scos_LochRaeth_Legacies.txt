Hash: D53BFF05, Key: Phase0Description, Value: Baewynn was right about the Chieftain. Either by true faith or blind subservience, he has abandoned the old ways and resigned Corbach to its fate.

I should meet up with the seer near Domhainne Tunnels to find the truth of the goatman raids and resulting famine.
