Hash: 5D226C1B, Key: Line1.B67DA, Value: I have the worst luck. We cast lots for this shift and I lost again! Barely made it back alive last time. The pay is high, but what good is coin if the undead make a meal of me?
Hash: CC2BD248, Key: VoiceDir1.B67DA, Value: Young. Way over his head. Frustrated. Complaining, but not annoying.
Hash: DE059BE0, Key: Line6.B67DA, Value: I don’t have a solution for the corpses. I just want a quiet shift. If you can give me that, I’ll give you half my pay.
