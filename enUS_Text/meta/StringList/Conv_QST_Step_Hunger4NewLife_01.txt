Hash: DF8BB81E, Key: VoiceDir25.6E261, Value: Distracted. Takes her a minute to recognize the player, as she's distracted by her suffering companion.
Hash: F56112CF, Key: Line23.6E261, Value: No! (cries) Get away from me!
Hash: 45973E9C, Key: VoiceDir23.6E261, Value: Scared, struggling. She's reliving a traumatic memory.
Hash: 294A05D3, Key: Line27.6E261, Value: She was fine when we left. But today, she just snapped... I have an idea to calm her, but I can't leave her alone like this. Maybe you could help?

Hash: C33E7F55, Key: Line29.6E261, Value: I--I kept a stash of uncommon medicinal herbs in a hideout, in the caves northwest of here. The tea I made with them was Oyuun's favorite.

Hash: E1A2E7B0, Key: Line33.6E261, Value: Take this. Fill it with the herbs if they're still there. Please hurry.
