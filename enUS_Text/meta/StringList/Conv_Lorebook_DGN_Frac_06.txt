A new beast nests in these caves. They are man-shaped, bearing fur and massive horns. If you see one:

Do not approach. 
Do not engage. 
Do not attack.
Hash: F3DEA160, Key: Line3.3F392, Value: Turn back and leave as quietly as you can. 

Once noticed and hunted by these beasts, you are beyond saving. Let the corpses here speak for themselves.

LIGHT GO WITH YOU.
