Hash: 9123F8DA, Key: Line5.BC41E, Value: I’ve a young man in my care who’s been bitten by a spider. His parents died just last week, bearing similar bites. The venom took them in mere hours... but something slows it in him. He's been clinging on for days.
Hash: 2B18725C, Key: Line7.BC41E, Value: Symptoms: Fever, cold sweat, wheezing breath. Odd little bumps that sometimes move beneath the skin. Won’t take food or water.
Hash: C50CEBDE, Key: Line9.BC41E, Value: The strangest one of all: other spiders won’t leave the poor lad alone. What draws them to the bite? Please, send help.
