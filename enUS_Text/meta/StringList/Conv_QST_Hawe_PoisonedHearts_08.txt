Hash: F75EAA33, Key: Line3.F53E7, Value: It is ancient magic that should calm her blood. It will be painful, Aneta. I hope you are prepared to pay the price.
Hash: 66681060, Key: VoiceDir3.F53E7, Value: Matter of factly. You will not sugar coat what comes next.
Hash: 0C698A30, Key: Line13.F52ED, Value: I'll do whatever it takes.

Hash: 2C945629, Key: Line27.F53E7, Value: Fine. Once you're done, meet me in the hidden glade east of here.
Hash: 7CCA81F6, Key: VoiceDir27.F53E7, Value: Avoid sounding like you're snapping at your student. "Fine" is more of a matter of factly acceptance of a request.
