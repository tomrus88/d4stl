A family of wasps has crept their way into a cave in the highlands. The wasps are harmless enough, but the locals have written to me in a panic. To think such tiny creatures could sow sheer chaos with their coming.
Hash: 727D884F, Key: Line11.EDC74, Value: You are strong in the language of swarms. You know the rhythms of their dances. Go to the highlands. Guide this brood from the cave and shepherd them home where they belong.
