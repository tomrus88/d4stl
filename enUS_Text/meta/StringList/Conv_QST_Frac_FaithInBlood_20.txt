Hash: 5D8555C1, Key: Line1.FEF63, Value: Yes. You did well, the demon is truly banished. I'm impressed you were able to copy the ritual so quickly. It took me ages to master.
Hash: CC8EBBEE, Key: VoiceDir1.FEF63, Value: Groggy, weak, waking up from a horrible nightmare.
Hash: 90FBAD52, Key: Line5.A9F43, Value: Sister Octavia, you are all right! But these people have engaged in blasphemy of the highest sort! Lying! Stealing holy implements! Brutalizing a priest of the Cathedral!
Hash: 0005137F, Key: VoiceDir5.A9F43, Value: arrogant, incredulous
Hash: 2AF026D4, Key: Line7.A9F43, Value: They will burn on the pyre before the day is out! How could you be so rash? When the Reverend Mother--
Hash: C5573BC9, Key: Line9.FEF63, Value: Oh? And what will you tell Prava? That you allowed a commoner to so easily deceive her holy representative? That you abandoned your flock in Margrave and left them with no guidance from the Light?
Hash: 3460A1F6, Key: VoiceDir9.FEF63, Value: smug but cold. This is a threat.
Hash: 729039D2, Key: Line11.FEF63, Value: If I am to be tied to that horrific pyre, then you shall be there with me!
Hash: C2C6659F, Key: VoiceDir11.FEF63, Value: cold, direct. This is a threat.
Hash: 0C1217E1, Key: Line13.A9F43, Value: (sigh) No, I--
Hash: A6069163, Key: Line15.A9F43, Value: I suppose I have been away from Margrave overlong. I should return swiftly.
Hash: F63CBD30, Key: VoiceDir15.A9F43, Value: backpedalling from a threat. Trying to escape and awkward conversation as quickly as possible.
Hash: 3FFB0AE5, Key: Line17.A9F43, Value: But, Sister Octavia, please, take better care of yourself. The Cathedral is stronger with you on your feet than in a sick bed.
Hash: 903136B2, Key: VoiceDir17.A9F43, Value: earnest. Octavia is important to you. more warmly than you would normally speak to someone.
