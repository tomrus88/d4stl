Hash: 5D73347A, Key: Line1.EED41, Value: I have been called to repentance. To this shrine in the center of an uncivilized swamp to make right what I have done wrong. But the swamp, like my past, is restless, angry, and full of whispers.
Hash: F767ADFC, Key: Line3.EED41, Value: I go to bed with its voice in my ear, reciting the litany of my sins. It says to me that my repentance means little. That in my heart I feel no remorse. That in the end there will be no absolution. Please...please...I must have absolution...
