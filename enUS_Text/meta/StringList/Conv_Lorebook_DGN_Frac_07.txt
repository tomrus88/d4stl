Hash: F767236F, Key: Line3.EDCC7, Value: As for your current duties, seal up the prison. I know the stories. Let them rot in their cages and darkness. If they wanted to be treated like humans, they wouldn’t have lived like animals. Perhaps we will teach them a lesson that they’ll carry into the next life.   
-Regards, Commander Finbar
