I met him decades ago. It was he who rejected my application to the Sanctum. He called me power-hungry, reckless. And I was.
Hash: F72F7F44, Key: Line3.BC420, Value: That rejection was a gift. It put me on my path, pushed me to seek bolder mentors. I now have the power I once sought.
Hash: 9123F8C6, Key: Line5.BC420, Value: When we took the Sanctum, I killed him myself. Raised him from the dead. Now he serves my every whim. A fitting legacy for a fool.
