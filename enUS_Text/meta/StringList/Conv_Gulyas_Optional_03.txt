Hash: CC7396DE, Key: VoiceDir1.F53E7, Value: genuinely impressed the player was proven worthy of an audience with a powerful creature.
Hash: F75EAA33, Key: Line3.F53E7, Value: I am impressed. I myself have not been in the Tree's presence in some time. It must see a great potential, or more likely a great value, in you.
Hash: 66681060, Key: VoiceDir3.F53E7, Value: somewhat snide on "value". The Tree does not care for its subjects, it only speaks with those who can do something for it, and you know it.
