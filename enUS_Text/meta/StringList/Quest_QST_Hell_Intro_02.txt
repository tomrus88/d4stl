Hash: 9FF0C7FF, Key: Phase73Description, Value: Triune have been exploiting the lingering Hatred emanating from the Black Tomb. Locran believes this Hatred stems from Sankekur's body, a former host of Mephisto and used to rupture Sanctuary's protective veil against Hell.

We must annihilate what is left of Sankekur. But what will we find if we open that tomb?

Hash: 94B19AE4, Key: Phase78Description, Value: Emerging victorious from the depths of the Black Tomb, Locran and I achieved our mission to destroy Sankekur. Yet, we leave not entirely whole. A demon unknown to me – Maffer the Cruel – gave Locran a vision during the ritual. Hell is coming. Hell is here.

Clearly, he is shaken... I should speak with him again in Rakhat Keep.
