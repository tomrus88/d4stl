Hash: F413C4CC, Key: Line3.6D03F, Value: We’re after a man named Elias.
Hash: 911B74B8, Key: Line5.C1CD2, Value: (Elias!) Elias. Slippery, that one. He owes the Tree. It deals in thoughts. An insight, in exchange for a head.
Hash: 0024DAE5, Key: VoiceDir5.C1CD2, Value: jealous
Hash: 2B0FEE3B, Key: Line7.C1CD3, Value: He is the first of us to escape payment.

Hash: C1F212B9, Key: Line9.6DE47, Value: Will you tell us what you told him? If we can stop him for good, the Tree can finally collect.

Hash: D6FCF6CA, Key: Line19.6DE47, Value: This place Elias stopped at, how can we get there?
Hash: 5E7F3AA4, Key: Line21.C1CD0, Value: Seek a coffin beyond the wrecks. It will take you where you must go. Find out what secrets linger there, for the Tree knows not.
