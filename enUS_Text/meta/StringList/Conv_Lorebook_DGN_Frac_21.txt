Hash: 915B9746, Key: Line5.EDC78, Value: I have tasted human blood. Gorged myself on it. Taken lives to do it. Damnedest of all, I enjoy it every time, hating myself all the while. I pray in the moments I still have clarity. But these moments slip from me like water through a sieve.
Hash: F7671DC4, Key: Line3.EDC78, Value: Iâ€™ve killed too many...I can live no longer. Tonight, I seal myself in this cave so that I might harm no others. 

In the name of the Light.
