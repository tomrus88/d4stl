Hash: 5D72A9EF, Key: Line1.EDCC9, Value: Ore extraction has ground nearly to a complete halt! I cannot get the workers to venture further into the mines, or even dig where they are at this point. I don’t blame them. We haven’t been paid in weeks. Yet the Trade Commission still demands their quotas.
Hash: F7672371, Key: Line3.EDCC9, Value: I long for the days of my father’s Caldeum, when the Commission did the bidding of the people instead of the other way around. I am at a loss as to what to do. I haven’t seen daylight in more days than I care to count. Sometimes, it feels like this mine may become my grave.
