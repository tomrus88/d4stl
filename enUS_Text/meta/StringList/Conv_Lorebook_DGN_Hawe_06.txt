Hash: F72F81EC, Key: Line3.BC3FE, Value: Nicos couldn’t take the hunger and went through a portal just yesterday. I’ve found moss and some rodents, but I don’t think it’ll last me long. I don’t want to go through a portal. I don’t know what’s on the other side. At least here there are no demons. At least here ... I’m alive.
