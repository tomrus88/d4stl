Hash: B0024827, Key: VoiceDir10.11E336, Value: Initially gracious and almost sickeningly sweet... until he begins to realize the ring they've found is inherently worthless. Then, disbelieving.
Hash: 0A0DF63E, Key: Line14.11E336, Value: This isn't real gold! Oh, this is so like him. I bet he's laughing up at me from the Burning Hells. You know what...  just keep it.

Hash: 318A4C7C, Key: Line12.11E336, Value: Maybe take it to that weird merchant in the Boiling Plains. I've heard he collects all kinds of worthless stuff like this.
Hash: 8885F1E9, Key: VoiceDir12.11E336, Value: Condescending when referring to the "weird merchant." Generally acting superior but feeling a bit defeated; he's just been thwarted but is trying to act above it all.

Hash: 398D456D, Key: VoiceDir16.11E336, Value: Increasingly annoyed and feeling defeated as the line goes on. Disdainful.
