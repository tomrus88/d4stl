Hash: 5D72A46D, Key: Line1.EDC7C, Value: The Cathedral of Light ordered us to cleanse Fort Eridu. At first, I thought this was a mistake. There wasn’t anything in the old fort, but we started to lose our men. We found them torn apart and barely recognizable.
Hash: F7671DEF, Key: Line3.EDC7C, Value: Death was granted for a lucky few, the other rose as shambling corpses. The trail of bodies led us to the demon infestation in the lower reaches.
Hash: 915B9771, Key: Line5.EDC7C, Value: No wonder this fort was left to rot. It’s sitting on cursed ground. I won’t lose any more knights. Tomorrow, I’m ordering my regiment to destroy this vile building and hopefully seal these demons inside. I pray they never escape.
