Hash: FB3FFC35, Key: MenuLabel, Value: “Nafain is dead by my hand. His hatred of the Knights Penitent led him into a pact with Lilith.”
Hash: 5A334C6A, Key: Line1.7FA05, Value: A pact?
Hash: C93CB297, Key: VoiceDir1.7FA05, Value: Disbelief. Nafain is the last person Donan would expect to make a deal with Lilith.
Hash: A327237F, Key: Line15.7FA05, Value: I gave him a seat at the table. I wanted him to work with us. He was incapable of seeing the Cathedral as anything more than invaders.
Hash: F35D4F4C, Key: VoiceDir15.7FA05, Value: Exasperated.
Hash: 6E8CB2DA, Key: Line17.BAE4, Value: There is more. Nafain told Lilith that Astaroth is hidden here, in the keep. Is that true?
Hash: D7101683, Key: Line19.7FA05, Value: Keep your voice down. His essence is here, but it is contained. Secure. Beyond Lilith’s reach. You must speak of this to no one. The last thing we need now is to cause panic.
Hash: 27464250, Key: VoiceDir19.7FA05, Value: Anxious for the first sentence (Donan is trying to keep this a secret). Flustered, gathering himself, and trying to be reassuring for the rest of the line.
