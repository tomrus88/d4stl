Hash: D53BFF05, Key: Phase0Description, Value: Torben told me the worn insignia belonged to a mercenary company from the Days of Ash. Blackweald Company. The same company of the fabled killer, the Bear of Blackweald.

Torben seems disturbed by the idea that they have returned. I should speak with him to see how they’re related to the merchant killings.
Hash: 61CFD437, Key: Phase11Description, Value: As Torben was telling me about Blackweald Company, we were interrupted by news of a large fire spotted on the southern ridge. Torben seemed disquieted by the news, saying he believes the fires are connected to Blackweald Company’s return.

He asked that I search for the source of the fires while he protects the Goose and its patrons.
