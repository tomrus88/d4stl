Hash: 5D72A440, Key: Line1.EDC76, Value: We’ve captured your scumbag warden and her team of enforcers. They abused, tortured, and degraded us for decades. You’re lucky they’re still alive.
Hash: F7671DC2, Key: Line3.EDC76, Value: And they’ll stay that way, in exchange for one thing: freedom. Open the gates and let us out. For each day our demand goes unanswered, another prison guard dies. 

Thirty-two remain. You have one moon, chieftains of Scosglen. Use it wisely.
