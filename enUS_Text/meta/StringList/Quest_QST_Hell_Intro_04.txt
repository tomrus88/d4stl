Hash: 68161728, Key: Phase3Description, Value: Locran sacrificed himself to open the path to the demon's source. I will continue to repel the Infernal Hordes, buying precious time for Sanctuary. Locran's loss will not be in vain. 

Among my Consumables, I now possess the Infernal Hordes compass. I will activate it when the time comes to confront the agents of Hatred again.
