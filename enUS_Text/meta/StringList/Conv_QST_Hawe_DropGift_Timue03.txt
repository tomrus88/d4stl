Hash: 5A39A25C, Key: Line1.9118B, Value: What is it now? A curious kind of venom, from the Nangari... I see.
Hash: F42E1BDE, Key: Line3.9118B, Value: You know, this is their place. We all came here from elsewhere. But not them, no.
Hash: 8E229560, Key: Line5.9118B, Value: Even I don't know how long they've been here, or how they came to be.
Hash: 28170EE2, Key: Line7.9118B, Value: This venom is clear because the Nangari it came from is about to begin molting. Or at least it was, I assume... you must have killed it? Yes, of course.
Hash: C20B8864, Key: Line9.9118B, Value: Perhaps the seasonal molt will begin soon. It's said to be lucky to keep some in your house, but it's only lucky if it's not full of parasites. That's what I always say.
