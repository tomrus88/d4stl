15th: Today Fang killed a deer. Thrice her size. We feasted.

Hash: F7156021, Key: Line3.B2A21, Value: 17th: Fang won’t stop challenging bears. Pa said she’s unnatural. Tried to put her down. He never keeps his promises.  

I’ll hide her here in the lodge. She was meant to be a hound. It’s in her blood. I’ll show him when she’s bigger. Then he’ll see.
