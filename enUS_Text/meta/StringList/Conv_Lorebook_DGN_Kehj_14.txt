Raised another undead today. Excellent specimen. Technique improving. Full mobility this time. Directed it to move a scroll. Scroll ended up in torn pieces. Must work on fine control of fingers and hands.
Hash: F767AE70, Key: Line3.EED6C, Value: Peers in the Clans might sniff at use of necromancy. But undead labor is cheap. (Free!) Library too valuable to let rot. But too expensive to hire mercenaries. If studies go well, who knows what gems I might discover here.
