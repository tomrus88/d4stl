Hash: 915B9744, Key: Line5.EDC76, Value: The crew is worried. They swear something more than a storm threw us off course. A few say they saw somebody watching us as the rowboats landed. I told them that fear is a trickster, and it must have been shapes in the rain.
Hash: F7671DC2, Key: Line3.EDC76, Value: I need them to focus on survival, not superstitions. It doesn't help that every sailor tells tales about these beaches. Legends say that it was once a hideout of the merciless Captain Murador and his crew. They say even in death he still guards these shores. I pray that he stays only a story.
