I have heard what is transpiring in the labyrinth. Three summoners driven mad by this Grinning One, as it is called. My daughter, why do you persist in trying to break the demon? You have nothing to prove. You are more the Vizjerei than I was at your age. There is wisdom in knowing when to move on.
Hash: CC453027, Key: VoiceDir1.BCB66, Value: A worried parent--pleading at first, stern toward the end.
Hash: F730437C, Key: Line3.BCB66, Value: Seal the demon and its minions away. Return to the clan. Please.  

I am asking as your father. Do not make me command it as the grand summoner.
