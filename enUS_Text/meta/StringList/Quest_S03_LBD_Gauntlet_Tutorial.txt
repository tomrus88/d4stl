Hash: 68161728, Key: Phase3Description, Value: I have heard strange rumors about the Horn of Trials â€“ a strange obelisk-shaped stone claimed to be the peak of Mount Nymyr. 

How it came to Gea Kul is unknown to me. I should investigate the city docks where the Horn lies and see if the rumors hold any truth.
