Hash: 8D581EC0, Key: VoiceDir17.9118B, Value: Character note for these re-records: Timue is no longer forgetful. Her mind and purpose are clear. However, there is a bit of a sage/oracle-flavor to her. She knows much about the swamp and its power. Her fate is that she must guide people toward the Tree of Whispers who are seeking it--but she knows that will often end badly for them. A hint of sadness to her life.
