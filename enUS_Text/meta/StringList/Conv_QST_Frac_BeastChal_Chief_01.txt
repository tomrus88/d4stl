Hash: 910BDD31, Key: Line5.B757A, Value: We display these trophies to honor the ancients, and guide their wisdom to us. The skulls remind me that death is always close at hand... theirs, or your own.

Hash: 5D22EA2D, Key: Line1.B757A, Value: (sigh) There is one skull I'm saving a place for: that of a goatman we've named Kauller the Collector. It hunts north of here, openly feasting on our fallen.
Hash: F71763AF, Key: Line3.B757A, Value: Kauller has challenged us. Were you to bring me its damned ugly head, you would gain great favor with the tribe.
