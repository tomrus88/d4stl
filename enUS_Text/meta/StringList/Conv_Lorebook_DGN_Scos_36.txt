Head of the house wants a hole in the cellar bricked up. Passage runs higher and wider than other hallways in the keep. Eh, must’ve been around much longer.
Hash: F7671DC0, Key: Line3.EDC74, Value: Limestone. Quarter shipment. Two hands should cover it. One good day’s work.
Hash: 915B9742, Key: Line5.EDC74, Value: I, uh, should mention, you’re the second crew we’ve asked. First backed out after they saw the hole. I won’t deny, the damn thing raises the hackles. But Donan’s offering twice your rate to keep this quick and quiet. 

What say you?
