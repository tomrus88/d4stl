Hash: 6736F1BC, Key: Line3.101CF8, Value: This part fits onto the first bit that you brought me. I believe it is the carving of a bear. Even though we are still missing the head, the shape of the legs and body are clear enough.
Hash: 3FBA9B7E, Key: Line5.101CF8, Value: We cannot risk that a bear totem be used with ill intent, not with all that we have already seen.
Hash: 8EB347FA, Key: Line1.101CF8, Value: Perhaps if you are to find the last piece, you should hunt the bears themselves. Using only part of a totem could have caused a flawed transformation.
